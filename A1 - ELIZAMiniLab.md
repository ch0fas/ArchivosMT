From what I gathered, it seems that ELIZA has trouble remembering personal data like my age. I also did another test in which I told it my name, and ELIZA directly told me that it wasn't interested in knowing my name, straight up telling me: `I AM NOT INTERESTED IN NAMES`. 

Something that I did find interesting is that it really wants you to keep talking to it. It told me `PLEASE GO ON` when I said "bye", and it also said it when I used the word "quit". 

In this example, a keyword that definitely fired was "no". After using it only once it accused me of having a negative tone, something I couldn't shake off even after strictly denying it.
